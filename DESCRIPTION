Description: Small collection of functions for dyadic binary/dichotomous
    sequence analyses, namely: implementation of Bakeman & Gottman's (1997) approach
    of using aggregated logit-models for estimating an actor-partner-interaction
    model; transforming sequences into multi-level data for estimating an APIM via
    generalized multi-level models; fitting a basic Markov model and translating
    transition probabilities into APIM coefficients; simulations which can be used
    to estimate the optimal sample size and optimal length of sequences. References:
