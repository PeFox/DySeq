Description: Functions for dyadic binary/dichotomous sequence analyses are implemented in this contribution.
             The focus is on estimating actor-partner-interaction models using various approaches, for  
             instances the approach of Bakeman & Gottman's (1997) <DOI:10.1017/cbo9780511527685>,
             generalized multi-level models, and basic Markov models. Moreover, coefficients of one model 
             can be translated into those of the other models. Finally, simulation-based power analyses are
             provided.
