Title: Functions for Dyadic Sequence Analyses
Author: Peter Fuchs
Maintainer: Peter Fuchs <Pete.Fuchs@gmail.com>
Depends: R (>= 3.2.1),
Imports: MASS
Suggests: TraMineR
Description: Small collection of functions for dyadic binary/dichotomous sequence analyses, e.g. transforming sequences into time-to-event data, implementation of Bakeman & Gottman's (1997) approach of aggregated logit-models, and simulating expected number of low/zero frequencies for state-transition tables. Further functions will be added other time. References: Bakeman, R., & Gottman, J. M. (1997) DOI: <10.1017/cbo9780511527685>.
