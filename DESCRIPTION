Description: Small collection of functions for dyadic binary/dichotomous sequence analyses, e.g. transforming sequences into time-to-event data, implementation of Bakeman & Gottman's (1997) approach of aggregated logit-models, and simulating expected number of low/zero frequencies for state-transition tables. Further functions will be added other time.
