#' Dyadic sequences of 64 heterosexual couples
#'
#' Will be used to exemplify a typical data structure
#' and to illustrate the several function of this package.
#' 
#' In the original sample study, which was promoted as a study on close relationship and stress,
#' 198 heterosexual couples living in Switzerland participated. 
#' 
#' The couples had to have been in the current romantic relationship for at least a year 
#' and to use German language as their main communication language. During the study, either 
#' the woman, the man, or both partners were stressed using the Trier Social Stress
#' Test (TSST; Kirschbaum, Pirke,  Hellhammer, 1993). For exemplification purposes, only those 
#' 64 couples are included where only the female partner was stressed.  Directly after the stress 
#' induction, both partners joint again and the couple was left alone for eight minutes. During 
#' this period (a 'fake' waiting condition) the two partners were filmed for 8 minutes divided 
#' into 48 intervals of ten seconds length. It was coded if the female partners showed stress
#' communication (SC) within an interval (sequence 1; Colums 50:97) and if the male partner showd
#' dyadic coping reactions (DC; sequence 2; columns 2:49). For rurther insides about dyadic coping 
#' and/or stress communication, see Bodenmann (2015).
